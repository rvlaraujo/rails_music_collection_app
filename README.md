# Rails Collection Music App

This is a simple Ruby on Rails full stack application to manage music albums, a requirement for the Moat Builders tech test.

More details about of the test requirements can be finding [here](https://gitlab.com/-/snippets/2167416)

### NOTES

* Just keep in mind this application are not completeness of features or design;
* Pagination feature added with [kaminari](https://github.com/kaminari/kaminari);
* The provided endpoint are not restful, so it's not possible to use Active Resource ([ARes](https://github.com/rails/activeresource));
* For best use of the endpoints, a Client (wrapper) for them was created. Inside each client methods, the services objects pattern (controversial, I know) is used to mount the response with one, or set of, Artist model class;
* For authentication, the [devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise) gem is used;
* Because authorization is so basic, for only one action in a specific action, it was made with a method in the Albums controller
* For tests, the following gems are used:
  * [rspec-rails](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails)
  * [capybara](https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara)
  * [shoulda-matchers](https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda-matchers)
  * [factorybot rails](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot_rails)
  * [faker](https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker)
